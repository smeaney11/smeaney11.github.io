*Reflecting on TypeScript: A Game-Changer for Software Engineering*

**The Power of TypeScript: A Newbie’s Perspective**

When it comes to TypeScript I am a complete newbie.  I really do not even have much experience with JavaScript and to my understanding Typescript is just JavaScript with some extra features.  That being said, I find TypeScript pretty similar to Java which I am most familiar with.  I am sure when I dive deeper into TypeScript I will find more differences but for now right at the beginning it does not seem so different besides some syntax. But as for the basics like methods

**TypeScript: A Good Programming Language for Engineers?**

As for if TypeScript is a good or bad language for Engineers in my opinion it is too early to tell, I do not have enough experience in it to answer one way or another, I am sure i can interview some software engineers and get their opinion on the matter but for now in my opinion I would say i will find out this semester if it is a good or bad programming language for engineering.

**Athletic Software Engineering: A Different Kind of Workout**

Athletic Software Engineering and I never went well together. I remember taking Cam Moore’s 211 Class and he would make us do a WOD at the beginning of class with a pen and paper with a different kind of problem each day, or maybe it was once a week I can't remember exactly.  I never did well in those exercises but he gave us credit just for attempting. I have taken a while off coding since ICS212 so I am pretty rusty in my syntax and overall skill in programming so I will need to get back on track fast to be successful in the WOD’s. I do think they are useful but also stressful at the same time.  Sometimes a job will require a quick fix so I do think that they are useful and can relate to the actual workforce as long as you have the internet to help you with finding a solution to the problem.
