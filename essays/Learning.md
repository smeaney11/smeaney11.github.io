*Learning to Code, Securing the Future: My Path in Computer Science and Cybersecurity*

**A Newbie’s Road to Mastery**

Everyone starts somewhere, for me that starting point was 2 years ago but I still feel like a beginner. As a student working towards becoming a professional software developer, my journey has been one of constant learning, trial and error, and small victories along the way. Programming isn’t just about writing code—it’s about problem-solving, creativity, and persistence.  It feels like I am trying to build a puzzle, but I can shape and color the pieces. When I write my first working function or debug a complex issue, I feel a rush of accomplishment that reminds me why I chose this path. The field of software development is vast, and while it may seem overwhelming at times, I see every challenge as an opportunity to grow.

**Learning by Doing: The Power of Hands-On Experience**

Unlike many other disciplines, computer science isn’t something you just read about—it’s something you do. Learning to code is best accomplished by building projects, experimenting with new concepts, and pushing through roadblocks. Whether it's creating a small web application, finishing our athletic coding exercises, or working together as a team to solve a problem, every line of code teaches me something new. Mistakes are inevitable, but they are also the best teachers. The more I code, the more I realize that failure is just another step toward proficiency.

**Cybersecurity: A Natural Extension of Computer Science**

While software development is my primary focus, cybersecurity has always fascinated me. In an era where digital threats are evolving rapidly, understanding how to build secure applications is just as important as knowing how to write efficient code. A computer science degree provides a strong foundation for cybersecurity by teaching fundamental principles of operating systems, networking, and cryptography. Knowing how software is built also means understanding its vulnerabilities, and that knowledge is crucial for both developers and security professionals.

**The Road Ahead: Bridging Passion and Profession**

Becoming a professional software developer isn’t just about landing a job—it’s about creating a mindset of continuous learning and adaptation. Technology changes quickly, and the best developers are those who stay curious, learn new tools, and never stop improving. Cybersecurity and programming are deeply interconnected, and I hope to use my knowledge of both to create secure, innovative solutions. As I continue my journey, I want to inspire others who are just starting out, reminding them that every expert was once a beginner.
