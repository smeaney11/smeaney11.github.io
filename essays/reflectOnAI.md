**Reflect on My Use of AI in ICS 314**

**I. Introduction**
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a huge part in modern education, and its emergence in software engineering is hard to ignore. Tools like ChatGPT, Bard, and GitHub Co-Pilot are now available at the click of a button, providing instant feedback, explanations, and code examples. In ICS 314, I used AI mainly as a learning companion, a resource to help me understand new concepts, debug tricky problems, and generate examples quickly. My primary tool was ChatGPT, though I occasionally tried Co-Pilot for alternative answers. While I did not rely solely on AI to do my work, I found it extremely helpful for speeding up problem-solving and reinforcing my understanding, Especially the WOD’s. While I believe I could have finished the WOD’s without AI, they did not give me the option to try because of the minimal time I was given to complete them.

**II. Personal Experience with AI**

Below is my reflection on AI usage for each course element.

Experience WODs

For the WOD’s I would rely on ChatGPT, especially to get the structure of the project set up quickly, then I could see what and where I needed to go in and tune up.  I just simply did not have the time to set up the structure of the project myself.


*In-class Practice WODs*

 The practice WOD’s I didn't need to rely on AI quite as much and it was good practice to try and set up the structure of the projects myself but I wouldn't say I completely did them myself without AI.


*In-class WODs*

We did not have any In Class WOD’s so i would refer this section back to #1.


*Essays*

 The Essays I did not use AI because ChatGPT doesn’t know my personal experiences with all the subjects so I would not rely on AI.


*Final Project*

 My group used AI for code documentation prompts like:
 “Write a clear docstring for a function that sends event data to Supabase.”
 The results were clear and easy to adapt. We also used AI to to solve Vercel Error messages, and there were a lot of them at first but it was able to guide up through the setup.


*Learning a Concept / Tutorial*

 When first learning about NextJs and React, I asked:
 “Explain NextJS and React to me in simple language.”
 ChatGPT’s layered explanation — starting simple and adding detail — made the documentation less intimidating.


*Answering a Question in Class or in Discord*

 Our in class discord was not very relevant to this class and also we did have in person sessions.


*Asking or Answering a Smart Question*

 I feel like ChatGPT was able to answer any questions on any topic I had to learn this semester.


*Coding Example*

 I asked: “Give me an example of using Underscore _.pluck to extract all names from a list of users.”
 While it worked, it also showed me why newer JavaScript array methods are preferred, which gave me perspective on evolving best practices.


*Explaining Code*

When we worked with API routes in Next.js, I wanted to fully understand how the request/response flow worked between the frontend and backend. I pasted the following code into ChatGPT and asked:

*Writing Code*

 When building a small form validator, I asked AI:
 “Write a JavaScript function that checks if a string is a valid email.”
 It provided a regex solution. I tested and modified it for better accuracy.


*Documenting Code*

 For our final project API routes, I asked:
 “Write concise JSDoc comments for this function.”
 The suggestions were clear and met style guidelines with minor tweaks.


*Quality Assurance*

 During a code review, I pasted a small snippet into AI with:
 “What’s wrong with this code? It keeps returning undefined.”
 AI pointed out that the variable was declared inside a block scope. This saved debugging time.


*Other Uses in ICS 314*

 I used AI to draft commit messages:
 “Summarize this code diff into a short, clear Git commit message.”
 It produced readable, action-based messages that improved repository clarity.



**III. Impact on Learning and Understanding**

AI didn’t just give me answers — it shaped how I approached problems. By comparing AI’s solutions to my own, I developed a better instinct for spotting errors and improving efficiency. It helped me visualize concepts faster, but also forced me to critically evaluate results rather than trust them blindly.

**IV. Practical Applications**

Outside ICS 314, I’ve used AI for debugging my personal Next.js project, creating Supabase API routes, and generating Markdown documentation. In real-world settings, AI accelerates prototyping, but still requires strong fundamentals to avoid introducing subtle bugs.

**V. Challenges and Opportunities**

Challenges included outdated examples (especially with Underscore), occasional overcomplication of simple problems, and the temptation to over-rely on it. The opportunity lies in integrating AI into coding labs with a “fact-check” step, teaching students to validate and refine AI outputs.

**VI. Comparative Analysis**

Traditional teaching builds foundational thinking skills and confidence in working without assistance. AI-enhanced approaches boost speed, offer alternative explanations, and give instant feedback. The ideal learning method blends both — starting with manual effort, then using AI to refine and verify.

**VII. Future Considerations**

AI will likely become a standard in software engineering education, much like calculators in math. The key will be teaching discernment — when to trust AI, when to cross-check, and how to prompt effectively. I’d like to see AI-assisted pair programming exercises in future ICS 314 iterations.

**VIII. Conclusion**

Using AI in ICS 314 has been like having a knowledgeable peer on call 24/7 — one who sometimes gives perfect answers and sometimes makes mistakes you have to catch. It enhanced my learning, improved my debugging speed, and broadened my understanding of software engineering concepts. My recommendation is to fully integrate AI into the course, but always pair it with critical thinking exercises so students learn to verify, adapt, and truly understand the solutions they get.
