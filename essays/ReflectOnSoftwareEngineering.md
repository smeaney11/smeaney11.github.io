**Reflect on Software Engineering**

**I. Introduction**

 When I first started this course, I thought it would be entirely about building web applications — learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and connecting everything with a backend. While that’s certainly part of it, I quickly realized the real goal was much broader: to understand the principles of software engineering that apply to any kind of software project, not just websites. Over the semester, I’ve learned about concepts like Athletic Software Engineering, Design Patterns, and Databases — skills that I can use whether I’m building a mobile app, a game, or even a command-line tool.
 
**II. Athletic Software Engineering**

Athletic Software Engineering is an approach to learning and improving software development skills that borrows ideas from sports training. Just like athletes build muscle memory and speed through drills and repetition, software engineers can build coding speed, accuracy, and problem-solving ability by practicing regularly under timed conditions. In this course, we experienced this through Workouts of the Day (WODs) — short, timed exercises that challenged us to complete coding tasks quickly and correctly. At first, these WODs felt stressful, but over time they trained me to stay calm under pressure, think logically on the spot, and write cleaner code faster. Outside of web development, this same training method could be used to sharpen skills in areas like data science, algorithms, or even competitive programming, where both speed and accuracy are critical.

**III. Design Patterns**

 Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. Instead of reinventing the wheel every time a problem comes up, developers can apply proven “templates” that guide how different parts of a program interact. For example, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern separates the data (model) from the user interface (view) and the logic that connects them (controller). While we used patterns like MVC in web apps, the same principle applies in other fields — such as game development, where separating game data from rendering logic can make updates and bug fixes much easier. Learning design patterns has helped me think about structure before jumping into code, which prevents messy projects later.
 
**IV. Configuration Management**

 Configuration Management (CM) is about keeping track of all the pieces of a project — the code, settings, dependencies, and documentation — in a way that ensures everyone is working with the same version. Tools like Git and GitHub make this possible by tracking changes over time and allowing multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work. CM isn’t just useful for web applications; it’s essential in any project with multiple contributors, whether that’s firmware for a device, a machine learning pipeline, or a shared data analysis script. Without it, collaboration quickly turns chaotic.
 
**V. Conclusion**

 This course taught me far more than just how to build a website. I learned how to manage work efficiently, design software with long-term maintainability in mind, and keep projects organized and consistent. These skills are not tied to any single programming language or framework — they’re part of the foundation of being a good software engineer. Whether I’m working on a solo passion project or collaborating on a large-scale system, the concepts of Agile Project Management, Design Patterns, and Configuration Management will stay with me long after this class is over.
